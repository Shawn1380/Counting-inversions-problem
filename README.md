# Counting-inversions-problem
Let A[1.. n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i &lt; j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. A modified merge sort algorithm is developed  that determines the number of inversions in any permutation on n elements in Î˜(nlgn) worst-case time.
